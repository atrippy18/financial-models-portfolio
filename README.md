Financial Models Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio of financial models created in Excel. This repository is designed to showcase various financial models I have developed, including Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analyses, sensitivity analyses, and other valuation techniques. Each model is documented with assumptions, methodologies, and guidance on how to use them.
