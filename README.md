# Financial Models Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of financial models created in Excel. This repository is designed to showcase various financial models I have developed, including Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analyses, sensitivity analyses, and other valuation techniques. Each model is documented with assumptions, methodologies, and guidance on how to use them.

## Repository Contents



## Model Descriptions



## How to Use These Models

1. Download the Excel files you are interested in.
2. Enable macros if needed, as some models may use VBA for automation.
3. Review the 'Assumptions' tab in each model to understand the underlying assumptions.
4. Enter your own data or modify assumptions as necessary to suit your analysis needs.
